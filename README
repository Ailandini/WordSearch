Word Search Code Kata for Pillar/Accenture X.0
Ansel Landini

Welcome to the Word Search!
To begin, please clone all files to a git repository on your local machine.
If you are unsure how to do this, please refer to the steps below, otherwise skip down to the "TO BUILD" section of the README file.

####SETUP GIT REPO####
Open a cmd window (a quick way to do this is to click the windows key and type cmd)
Navigate to the folder you would like to set up the repo (navigate forward through files with cd <Folder Name> and backward with cd ..)
Type the following:

> git init
> git clone https://github.com/Ailandini/WordSearch.git

After a moment the files should clone to your directory and you are ready to build the project.

####TO BUILD####
To build the Word Search project, navigate to the location of the cloned repository.
Type the following:

> cd WordSearch
> gradle test

Gradle will take a few moments to load as it establishes a Daemon, once it finishes it will display a line containing
the number of tests and whether they passed or failed.

The Word Search project is designed to allow you to provide it a test puzzle as input. For your convenience, the project
repository contains a number of test puzzles with the naming convention: Inputs/WordSearchTestPuzzle# where # can be any
number between 1 and 7. Note that puzzles 4 and 6 will return unsolved as they purposely contain errors.
Note that if you provide your own test puzzle to the project, you will need to provide the full path file within the args string.
For example if your puzzle is saved to the desktop: --args='C:\Users\<YourUserName>\Desktop\<PuzzleName>.txt'.
Type the following:

> gradle run --args='Inputs/WordSearchTestPuzzle7'

The project outputs the words and their respective (x,y) coordinates to the command line.
Note that (x,y) directly correlates to (column, row).
If at any time you would like to rebuild the project.
Type the following:

 > gradle clean
 > gradle test

I hope you enjoy my Code Kata, and look forward to any suggestions/feedback provided :)
